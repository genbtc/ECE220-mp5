/*
 * INTRODUCTORY PARAGRAPH
 * ----------------------
 * The following code is used to play the codebreaker game. The user enters a seed which generates a random sequence of four numbers. They are then given 12 attempts
 * to guess the correct solution. After making each guess the user is told how many perfect and imperfect matches they got so that they can use this information to
 * improve upon their prior guess.
 * The 'set seed' function within this code simply checks if the entered seed is valid and proceeds accordingly. The 'start game' function generates the random
 * sequence. Finally, the 'make guess' function allows the user to enter an input of 4 integers. It then checks the validity of this input and, if it is valid,
 * compares this to the actual sequence to provide feedback on the matches.
